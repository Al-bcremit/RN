// The below type is used for HostObjects retured by the JSI API that don't have
// any accessable fields or methods but can carry data that is accessed from the
// c++ side. We add a field to the type to make it possible for typescript to recognize
// which JSI methods accept those types as arguments and to be able to correctly type
// check other methods that may use them. However, this field is not actually defined
// nor should be used for anything else as assigning any data to those objects will
// throw an error.
